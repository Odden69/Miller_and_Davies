The HTML-validator testing in this project taught me to do that kind of testing continuously. It would have spared me a lot of work at this stressful stage of the project.  
I ended up with a few errors left. All but one coming from labels and fields on forms. These errors could obviously have been solved, but since these errors all showed up on pages generated by Allauth or from code in large copied from the Boutique Ado project, it would have taken more skills to penetrate them than I was able to muster with no time left.  

#### HTML Errors
<details>
  <summary>Click to see HTML Errors</summary> 

HTML Errors on the Sign Up Page  
Duplicate id:s generated from the Allauth form.  
![HTML Error on Sign Up Page](images/tests/w3_html_sign_up.png)  
HTML Errors on the Add Product Page
Duplicate attributes and a p tag inside a strong element. I am not sure why it was done like this, and since it was working I left it without change.

HTML Errors on the Edit Product Page  
The small image on the edit product form should have an alt attribute.
